# Conway's Game of Life
This program was done as a mandatory exercise in the course IN1000 - introduction to Object-Orientated Programming.
The purpose of the program is to simulate the life and death of cells, also called Conway's Game of Life. In short, the program should keep track of a game board of any size, where each field in the board contains a cell. A cell can be alive or dead. 

The simulation takes place through several generations with the help of regular updates, where cells die or live depending on their environment. The program will allow the user to observe the simulation generation by generation by drawing the game board in the terminal together with additional information about which generation we are looking at and how many cells are currently alive.
